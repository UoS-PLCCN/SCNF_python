# SCNFN Python
A Python implementation of the SCNFNs, a PBN-alternative optimized for inference of large-scale networks from time series data. Introduced by [Ifigeneia Apostolopoulou and Diana Marculescu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8606450).

## TODO
- [x] SCNF Logic Clause inference.
- [x] SCNF Bernoulli variable optimization.
- [x] SCNFN to PBN Conversion.
- [ ] PBN to SCNFN Conversion.
- [x] Integration of Schiebinger data.

## Usage
Install with:
```sh
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/UoS-PLCCN/SCNF_python.git
```

### Example
For an example of usage, refer to `main.py` of this repository. To run it, you need to install the package with the `demo` extras.
